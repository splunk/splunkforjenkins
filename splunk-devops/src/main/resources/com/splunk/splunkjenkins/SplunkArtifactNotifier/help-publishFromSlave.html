    Publish log files directly from the slave, instead of proxying the process to the master.
    When publish from slave is selected, Jenkins master will transfer the plugin and its dependence to slave and
    initiate
    the publishing process from the slave.
    Take below into consideration:
    <ul>
        <li>slave and master load
        </li>
        <li>
            log file size
        </li>
        <li>
            slave type, long lived slave or one time use slave
        </li>
    </ul>
    Rule of thumb for selecting publish type:

    <ul>
        <li> a. if log files size is less thn 5MB, publish from master is preferred.</li>
        <li> b. if Splunk instance is in an isolated network which is not reachable from slave, you need publish from
            master.
        </li>
    </ul>
